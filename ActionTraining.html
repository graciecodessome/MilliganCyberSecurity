        There are several actions that students can take to protect themselves from cyber attacks.

        <h1> What Can You Do to Prevent A Cyber Attack</h1>
        <h4>
            HTTPS vs HTTP sites
        </h4>

        If you notice in your url on websites that you are on, they typically start with either an "http" or an "https"

        Websites that start with https are "secure" because they use a "secure socket layer certificate" to protect your information. Your information is encrypted as it passes
        from your browser to the websites server. This means that hackers cannot see your data as it is on route to the webiste's server.
        <br>Try to use as many https sites as you can. If you see one of your sites is only http, do not put personal information into that site.
        
        <h4> Scan Your Devices</h4>

        There are many antivirus softwares out there that you can use to scan your computer for any viruses, malware, or potential threats. A good one to use is "Malwarebytes." These 
        softwares can show you if your computer has any threats or has been impacted by cyber attacks, allowing you to take action and lessen the effect.

        </li>

            Incorporate numbers and special characters
        </li>
        <li>
            Do not use personal information in passwords
        </li>
