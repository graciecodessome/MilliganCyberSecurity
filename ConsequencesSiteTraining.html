            Consequences
        </h3>

        <p>
            There are several consequences that result from a cyber attack. Some of the ones that college students should be aware of are identity theft, malware, ransomware, data breaches, and phishing consequences.

            <h4>
                Ransomware Attacks
            </h4>
            Ransomware attacks compromise valuable data and can even shut down your systems for an extended period, making it very difficult to conduct normal operations.
            <br>
            Ransomeware attacks are like digital kidnappings for your files. Hackers lock up your important personal infomration and won't give it back until you pay a ransom.
            <br>
            Ransomware attacks have affected students across the United States. For example
            <li>
                Just last year in April, BlueField University fell victim to a ransomware attack because hackers threatened all of their students by sending them a message telling them
                 all of their personal information would be sold on the dark web if they didn't pay them money.

            </li>
            <li>
                Knox College, a private liberal arts institution in Illinois, made headlines late last year when a hacker group broke into its computer system and accessed
                 student data and threatened to sell their data.

            <h4>
                Phishing Scams
            </h4>
            Students often get tricked by phishing scams, where someone pretends to be 
            from a trusted company or person to steal their login information. This scam 
            often comes in the form of emails that appear to be important but are from a hacker
            <br>
            <li>
                Evan Fandrei, a college student at California State University almost fell victim to a phishing scam where he got a email from a student telling him to copy and paste a link into his web browser
            </li>
            
            <br>
            Clicking on an unknown email link can...
            
            <li>
                Malware can be downloaded on to your device by clicking on the link in the email
            </li>
            <li>
                Attackers can obtain login credentials , which then they can use them to access sensitive information.

            </li>
            <li>
                Personal Information can be locked behind a paywall, and only way to obtain the information is to pay the attacker money.

            </li>
            <li>
                The schools web system can be compromised and gain access to the student body personal information by clicking on the unknown link in a email.
            </li>

            <h4>
                Identity Theft
            </h4>
            
            Identity theft is where someone steals your personal information and pretends to be you doing things. Attackers can 
            steal your tax refunds, pretend to be you if arrested, use your health insurance for medical care, damage your credit score
            or rating, and can open any account under your name.

            <h4>
                Data Breaches
            </h4>

            Data breaches are when hackers get into a company or someone's computer to gain information, or "data." They can then use the data to 
            steal other information inside the company
