            Cyber attacks are on the rise and colleges are at risk.  
            College cyber attacks have increased 75% with 74% of attacks being successful, which is a higher success rate than businesses, healthcare, and financial institutions.
            
            <br>
            <br>
            Higher education is 
            a target of cyber attacks due to a variety of reasons.
            <br>

            <li>Colleges contain a wealth of data from students personal and financial information to faculty, staff, and workers. </li>
            <br>
             <li>Colleges also often contain wide, sprawing networks with lots of points of vulnerability for attack. Think about all the different buildings that a school has with internet access. Also think of 
             all the places where students connect to the internet via their laptop, phone, TV's etc. All of these are places where a cybercriminal can attack.
             </li>
             <br>
            <li>Colleges also use a plethora of third party or subcontractor programs. These are programs and systems that Milligan does not own, but has liscenses to use and put personal information on. These are things like Canvas, PowerCampus, etc. 
            Colleges are dependent upon the security measures of the third party programs for protecting their personal information.
             </li><br>
            <li>Colleges also have small IT budgets to protect their information, making their system more suseptable to cyber attacks
            </li>
