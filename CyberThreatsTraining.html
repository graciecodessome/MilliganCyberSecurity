            <li> Downloading Malwalre disguised as valid content. Be careful what you download and that you know the source. Use document checkers whenever neccessary to verify downloaded material is what the site claims them to be.
            </li>
            <li> Phishing Scams (Fake Emails)  Phishing scams are when someone sends you a fake email. The email could ask you for personal information or tempt you to download malware.
